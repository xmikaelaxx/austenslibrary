    <p> Our idea has been, from the beginning of this journey (yeah it's
    been a week), to make sure that people get to read as much as they'd
    like. Books are expensive, and they need to be, we don't want you
    to never buy another book. But this is a simple way to complement
    your usual book-buying-behaviour that makes this world go round. 
    We appreciate your interest and hope you'll stick around and
    browse for a while, maybe even find a book or two to rent.</p>
